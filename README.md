# DXLR8
DXLR8 `(de-accelerate)` is a simple firmware for Arduino-based devices that enables [Dynamic Brake Light](https://youtu.be/56WTZThaWt4?t=16) on any motorcycle.
## How it works
DXLR8 uses an accelerometer to detect when the motorcycle is braking, so no connection to the ECU or the braking system is needed.
If the deceleration is greater than a certain threshold the brake light flashes in order to warn vehicles behind of an intense braking.
